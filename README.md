# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

* Started this off by creating variables for all characters that will be used to formulate "secure password" (Upper/Lower case, numbers and special characters).
* Next, I created different inputs on my HTML to specify which options should be excercised in the password and followed up by creating variables for character inputs to be changes upon selection 
* Then, created an IF statement that will add each different option to my validcharacters variable if checked on the input checkbox 
* Created Function that will return randomized characters (either number or strings) which is converted using the ParseInt method 
*
* Created a function that will generate a password based on IF/WHICH one of the option are checked off in the input boxes
* Function that will make a password and add to the password input with an IF statement that makes sure user enters a number between 8-128 deciding before getting a generated password 
* Finally an event listener that calls the writePassword function when the generateBTN is clicked.
